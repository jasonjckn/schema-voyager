Now the fun part!

## View web page

After [running](/doc/installation-and-usage.md) Schema Voyager, open `schema-voyager.html` in your browser.
Have fun getting to know your schema!

## Share web page

`schema-voyager.html` is a single file containing HTML, CSS and JS.
It embeds your entire schema and doesn't communicate with a server (we promise! feel free to review the code).
Therefore it can be committed, emailed, hosted on a server of your choice, or otherwise shared anywhere.

## Share ERDs

Within the HTML you're sure to notice the diagrams of collections and their relationships.
These diagrams can be exported as SVG files.
Open the configuration menu in the upper left of any diagram and click Export SVG.
