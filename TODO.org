** DONE from db with a command line tool
   CLOSED: [2020-04-07 Tue 16:00]
The tool should be a 'quick view' of an unfamiliar database, one that hasn't yet been annotated with supplemental schema.
The tool should parse command line args for the client config and db name.
Then it should ingest the db, inferring references and deprecations.

* DONE Fix usage from within a project
  Problem: You can't really use s-v from within another Clojure codebase. This
  is a problem because those codebases are closest to the original schema
  definition, client connection parameters etc. And more practially, because the
  DataScript DB is put in the project resources/, not s-v's resources, meaning
  that resource/inline doesn't work. Maybe? Needs research
** DONE Create way to build website with arbitrary db input.
** CANCELED Create version of website that allows upload of s-v.db
* DONE convert to clojure tool
** DONE Unify CLI to a single invocation
*** DONE many sources
*** DONE many kinds of sources
    * files

    * functions, referenced by symbols
    * static data
*** DONE db inferences
*** DONE db exclusions (?)
*** DONE output to standalone html
* DONE Rename standalone.html to schema-voyager.html, or make it configurable?
  better branding of schema voyager
* DONE fix print-references
  It fails with some cryptic message related to compiling js (!)
  Also check that docs for print-inferences (doc/datomic-inference.md) actually work
* CANCELED move away from yarn scripts
  possibly a clojure.tools.build script would work
* DONE simplify spread of files
  * DONE slim down dev/
  * DONE move assets/ into resources/
* TODO create a build script
** TODO run clj -X:build-template
** TODO Create tagged version
   check that find-versions can actually find the tool
* TODO reintroduce quickstart, as a way of seeing full workflow
  basically just -X:cli ingest followed by -X:export standalone
* TODO convert datomic (and hiccup?) deps to :optional
  Would this ensure they're loaded when using s-v directly, but not when using from a project?
  And would this let us get rid of the :datmoic and :export aliases, and the dev directory/namespace?
    The dev directory also exists to support Netlify, so maybe not
* TODO Reorganize deps in deps.edn. What is really needed, and when?
  development/live
  release
  standalone
  standalone with Datomic
* TODO consider renaming cli/standalone to standalone-html or just html
  if it would read better in the docs
